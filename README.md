# Rock Band 3 DLC to Rock Band 2

![Header Image](dependencies/media/header.png)

Welcome to the RB3 DLC to RB2 repo. 

It's highly recommended that if installing in bulk, to pack together the songs you want using [Nautilus](https://nemosnautilus.com/nautilus/) or [Onyx](https://github.com/mtolly/onyx/). Note that some of these CONs will be updated over time. 

When adding your chosen songs to a pack, it is also highly recommended to put the following script in the pack's songs.dta so you don't get any duplicate entries in Rock Band 3:
- `#ifndef kControllerRealGuitar` (this goes on the very top of the songs.dta)

- `#endif` (this goes at the very bottom of the songs.dta)
